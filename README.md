# Friend-finder

##### How it works
* Friend finder will ask the user a series of questions, and then register the answers as values.
* These values will later be used to compare the latest user's answers to other users'
* Based on this comparison, the server will then send a response with the best match
* And voila! You've found a person with similar tastes ... a new friend
